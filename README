DESCRIPTION
       This widget provides a dynamic image that looks just like
       a Mac OS 9 progress bar.  Packed around it are four
       Frames, north, south, east and west, within which you can
       stuff additional widgets. For example, see how Tk::Copy::Mac
       uses several Labels and a CollapsableFrame widget to cre-
       ate a reasonable facsimile of a Macintosh copy dialog.
